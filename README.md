Welcome to the Brain Games! This project contains five arithmetic games. The player selects the desired game and starts it. In each game, you need to give three correct answer in a row. The game then ends with the player's victory. If the answer is incorrect, the correct answer is reported and the game ends. Games that are included: brain-even(determining an even number), brain-calc (addition, subtraction or multiplication of tho numbers), brain-gcd (finding the greatest common divisor of two numbers), brain-progression(finding the missing number in a progression), brain-prime(determine whether a number is prime). The video shows examples of work. Text from the video can be copied.
